# Library Management Database

## Description
A MySQL database designed for managing a library, including books, authors, members, and borrowings. The database includes proper relationships (1-1, 1-M, M-M) and constraints (PK, FK, NOT NULL, UNIQUE).

## How to Run/Setup
- Import the `library_management.sql` file into MySQL using the command:

Replace `username` with your MySQL username and `database_name` with your database name.
- Alternatively, use a tool like phpMyAdmin to import the `.sql` file.
